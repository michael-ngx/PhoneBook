A program that maintains a personal phone book. 

The data in the phone book is maintained by storing in memory with the use of a singly linked list, with 
one list node per entry. Each node contains members for storing a person’s family name, first name, address, 
and  the  phone  number. The  linked  list  is kept  in  increasing alphabetical  order,  sorted  by  family  name.
There  are  no  duplicate  entries  with  the  same  family  name allowed in the phone book. 
 
This program is menu driven, with the user being offered a choice of the following commands described below: 

▪ Insert a new entry into the phone book. 

▪ Delete an entry from the phone book. 

▪ Search for a family name in the phone book. 

▪ Search for a phone number in the phone book. 
 
▪ Print the phone book.

▪ Quit the program.
